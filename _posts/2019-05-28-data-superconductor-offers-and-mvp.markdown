## Data Superconductor – The Data JPS Product Suite

Our promise is to enable frictionless access to data for the right people at the right time. We reflected on our company name – Data JPS, taken from Joules Per Second which is how you measure power (Watt – get it?). In electricity, resistance is a direct analogy for friction, and Superconductors have zero resistance. The perfect analogy for us.

We then picked names from key physicists in the field of&nbsp; electrical conductivity:

| **Physicist** | **Context** |
| **Meissner** | [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissner\_effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissner_effect) |
| **Bardeen**   
 **Cooper**   
**Schrieffer** | [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCS\_theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCS_theory) |

Our suite is designed to complement and help implement the popular 5 Safes Framework (Statistics 2017, Stokes 2017)

## Software Products

We have four software framework products – all available as either software only or SaaS (Software as a Service):

[Meissner Policy Explorers](https://datajps.com/meissner-policy-explorers/)

[Bardeen Secure Data Science Lab](https://datajps.com/bardeen-secure-data-science-lab/)

[Cooper Data Integration Workbench](https://datajps.com/cooper-data-integration-workbench/)

[Schreiffer Content Discovery and Collaboration Environment﻿](https://datajps.com/schreiffer-content-discovery-and-collaboration-environment/)

The links above describe the products and show the first MVP – Minimum Viable Product – for each.

## Services

All our software products are available in a SaaS model – much like Databricks (‘AzureDatabricks | Microsoft Azure’ 2018)

Unlike most SaaS offers, it’s not as simple as handing over your credit card and plugging in your data. There will be some integration required for each client to create a secure trusted zone to share data. This means there are some initial start up costs.&nbsp;

We also offer professional services packages for software implementation with a view to customer becoming increasing self reliant.

## Services Minimum Viable Product

We will provide a templated, fixed price SaaS implementation package to enable clients to use our SaaS offering. We will do this for each product offer in the Data Superconductor suite

We will provide a custom, time and materials based service offering for implementing our offering within the clients own environment.

## Validating our products

We test all of our products by working closely with the Victorian Government. Our co-development agreement includes VicGov providing a variety of different stakeholders who will use our products as part of our delivery teams. This makes sure that requirements are always right and responsively updated that we deliver high quality, fit-for-purpose products.
