# BizDevOps

Over the last few years BizDevOps has emerged as a highly efficient, pragmatic and effective way to align business needs with best practice engineering to deliver functionality that the organisations need in line with business priorities. By co-developing our products with the Victorian Public Sector, Data JPS is well placed to leverage BizDevOps to build and maintain our products:

The market is also adopting these methods, with capability from software vendors and service providers readily available â€“ which de-risks our approach.
