## Introduction

We open with a high level framework that presents the chosen strategy so you can quickly understand what we will do. The supporting evidence follows, including a Lean Canvas, SWOT analysis, and discussions on Product Market Fit, the Customer Development Process and finally our Governance approach. This evidence is presented on linked pages for readability.

### Strategy and framework

We are using the Strategic Choice Cascade approach for strategy, developed by A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin in their book ‘Playing to Win’ (2013)

| **Strategic Choice** | **What the choice does** | | **What your choice is** |

| **Where will you play?** | A playing field where you can achieve that aspiration. | | We work exclusively in the public cloud – it lowers our costs, makes it easier to scale and faster to adopt services and innovations that help our clients 
- Initially this means Azure because of the additional ASD Certification 
- Ultimately multi-cloud

- Pay for support 
- Pay for priority features 

**Build model**

- Co-development with VicGov

  - actionable 
  - accessible 
  - auditable

# So what do we need next?

We have a strong technical team and we’re confident with the strategy, approach and product market fit. We also have funding to develop the first customer offerings. But we need help with the first 3 capabilities in the table under ‘What capabilities must be in place?’

- Financial Planning
- Product Pricing
- Marketing

That’s where we are seeking help and investment.
