title: About Data JPS

Hi,

I’ve been working with large scale data platforms my whole career, with \>25 years in Data Integration, Big Data, Analytics and Operational Data platforms. The title Data JPS is a play on the formula for a unit of power:

Power = Joules Per Second (JPS).

The unit of power is a watt – which links nicely to my last name – Watt. OK enough puns.

I like technology. I like data. I like helping people get the best value from both. I’ve done that a lot, across 4 continents for many businesses. And, while I’m always learning, I see a lot of trends repeat themselves like:

- Scaling that proof of concept is much more difficult that you thought it was going to be (for users, or for data, or for new functions, or for complexity, etc.), or;
- Rolling out that new insight operationally still needs people to agree that the data is valid going in, as well as coming out, or;
- Finding the right people to use that cool new technology in the market is hard – and training your current people to use also seems tricky…
- etc.

Solving problems at scale is what I like doing most of all.

I’ll keep posting and I hope you find it interesting.
