Policy explorers enable policy officers and executives to use data to understand the policy landscape in a frictionless way. Data has been aggregated, anonymised and desensitised before being presented to endusers. This confidentialisation process is validated using reidentification risk algorithms – data that does not pass agreed thresholds of risk are withheld from the explorer. There are three themes which together provide a complete overview of policy issues:

1. Population Explorer
  - Providing person themed perspectives that address policy areas including social welfare, health, justice, education and policing
2. Economy Explorer
  - Providing Business, industry and regional economic activity policy perspectives
3. Place Explorer
  - As well as a hub for environmental and, regional and other geospatial activity, this provides a central hub to enhance analysis for the Population and Economy Explorers

## Minimum Viable Product

For each explorer, we will provide charts or dashboards to help answer the top 10 enduring policy questions in state government. These questions will be identified from prioritised survey responses of policy officers, initially in Victoria (as we are co-developing with the Victorian State Government).

These charts and dashboards will be written in the open source visualisation tool&nbsp;[R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)&nbsp;to reduce adoption barriers – given it is free of license costs (notwithstanding server operating costs) and runs in a user’s browser – enabling easy roll out in tightly controlled desktop environments like that found in government departments. Check out our [roadmap](https://datajps.com/data-superconductor-roadmap/) for the next 12 months
