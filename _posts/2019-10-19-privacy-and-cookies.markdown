Your privacy is important to us. It is Data JPS policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, [https://datajps.com](/).

## **Information from website browsers**

If you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs, to collect Technical Information. This is stuff we collect from every visitor.

The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We use this information to improve your experience using our website and to offer targeted advertisements from Google Adsense, that helps to fund the site.

## Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to “remember” you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as “first party cookies”), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (“third party cookies”).

The table below explains the types of cookies we use on our websites and why we use them.

This means that:

<!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
- Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to datajps.com or other websites.
- Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to datajps.com users based on their visit to datajps.com and/or other sites on the Internet.
- You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). (Alternatively, check some other ways to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting [www.aboutads.info](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/).)
<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->

You can use your browser settings to block the cookies we use.

## Reasons for collecting personal information

We ask for personal information for one of only two reasons:

<!--kg-card-begin: markdown-->
1. to provide an information service to you
2. as part of academic research that we contribute towards from time to time.
<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->

We collect personal information only by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.

## Processing Personal Information

We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with the information service or, if collected for academic research, until the peer review process has been completed.

What data we store, we’ll protect within according to [Australian Privacy Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/)(APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act). The APPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure and dispose of your Personal Information.
