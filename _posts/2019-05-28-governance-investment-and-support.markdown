We’ve made some great progress in developing a partnership with the Victorian Government, with a clear [product vision](https://datajps.com/data-superconductor-roadmap/) that meets specific need for state (and federal and local) government that the market is not addressing right now. But we also know we have gaps in our capability and we need support to grow the company.

We have little experience in creating start ups, so we are seeking new members for our board, and we think the following structure would be appropriate for us:

But, since we are new at this, we are seeking more guidance and are open to suggestions. We have a well established product development team, and a strong, customer focussed development [methodology.](https://datajps.com/customer-development-process/) To run our business better, and hit our potential, we need to bring in new skills around product pricing, marketing and financial planning. We are seeking these skills through a Venture Capital partnership.

The organisation structure below shows how we think our current organisation will fit in with the new people we need in finance, product pricing and marketing.

## What we need

If you haven’t already, check out our [pitch video](https://datajps.com/index.php/projects/vc-invest/). To be clear, here’s the detailed ask. We need fund and hire the following roles:

And we need to revise and update our board structure. If you’re interested, let us know.

Thanks for your consideration.
