This is an integrated intranet search experience for policy officers and executives – linking search results on policy questions to data visualisations, reports and explorers and presenting alongside policy briefings and related service offerings

## Minimum Viable Product

There are two components to the MVP, with enhancements to follow based on demand – a data catalogue, and an API to integrate with search engines.

The data catalogue will automatically parse incoming data sources to extract useful context, and present to the user. Useful context includes data quality, recency, latency, descriptions of fields (and overall dataset), common usage patterns, domain experts (people) and owners)

We will initially provide a simple API to return and integrate results from our data catalogue into the enterprise search capability.

The API returns not only search results, but links to corporate social networks for the data custodians and data experts. It uses machine learning capability to learn what results are useful (based in part on log analysis from the search results requiring a feedback look from the on-premises search engine). A simple API will be delivered first, with enhanced collaboration capability to follow late next year (see [roadmap](https://datajps.com/data-superconductor-roadmap/) for more details).
