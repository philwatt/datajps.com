Our co-development agreement with the Victorian Government (VicGov) establishes a low risk funding vehicle to delivery products and services to enable and enhance data driven decision making in government – not only here in Victoria, but across Australia and beyond.

The agreement has been brokered as both Data JPS and VicGov recognise both the latent need and growing demand for these services and a market that does not yet address this demand. Rather than invent something and keep it in Victoria, VicGov is keen to establish common best practice and implementation to drive better data sharing and analytics across state and federal government departments. That’s where we can help.

Together, Data JPS and VicGov have canvassed each state government to understand their need and readiness. The need is there, but readiness varies across each state. We have a strong roadmap based on identified and prioritised need and an existing highly capable product development team.

Our [strategy](https://datajps.com/index.php/data-jps-data-superconductor/technopreneurship-strategy/) highlights the ask we have for investors: we need help with financial planning, product pricing and marketing (our team is built on technical and delivery excellence). But the detail of what we need is in shown in [Governance, Investment and Support](https://datajps.com/governance-investment-and-support).
