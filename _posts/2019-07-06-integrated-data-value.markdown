Just about every business does it. Most people don't see the value. I created a short video explaining what it is, and why people spend so much money on it.

<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2ANfvtXCaU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

I'm reasonably happy with it, and have figured out how to better manage the audio (thanks to iMovie) . &nbsp;I used [renderforest.com](https://renderforest.com) to create it but it's not really designed for doing videos that need to follow a strong corporate identity (you can't customise the fonts, and so on).

Escient may or may not choose to use it for their official channels, but I think the message is good and explains some concepts I've been touting for many years.

Anyway, I want to credit [Jason Sharpe](https://linkedin.com/in/jasonryansharpe) &nbsp;and [Julian Hebden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianhebden) who inspired the diagram explained in the video, back in 2013 when we were all at Telstra.

There are some follow up questions that fall out of this, like 'does it have to be so expensive?' and 'how do we do more of it with less money?'. Harder questions, answers to which may vary by your own situation...
