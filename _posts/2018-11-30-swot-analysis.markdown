## Positive

We have consulted widely with state and federal government departments across Australia, with a very positive reception for our product vision and business model. There is a high pent up demand for our offering with governance, security and modularity a key requirement. The Victorian Public Service (VPS) has offered to co-develop our products and services which gives them early access to valuable policy insights and gives us product validation and track record.

## Negative

Government departments at all levels are notorious for being somewhat process bound in order to maintain public trust and follow probity rules. This can have a drag in product development and sales efforts which we need to be mindful of â€“ particularly as it can decelerate our path to product maturity. Our competitors have mature products (even if they do not fully address client concerns). If we cannot effectively match the pace of requirement fulfilment demanded by our prospects these prospects may choose alternatives (like competitors or build themselves).
