## Market Adoption

Analytics in the cloud is fast becoming mainstream for businesses of all sizes, banks and telcos are investing heavily in this space. There is a large amount of choice for cloud based analytics tools – so why have government departments been slow to adopt them unlike businesses?

## Cloud service offering challenges

Governments have been slower to ‘cross the chasm’ than businesses but are now more open to using cloud services. Nearly all of the products or services in the market suffer from one or more of the following issues – which lead to government departments disqualifying them. Note, the issues are not exclusive to government, but as public servants are typically more risk averse, these issues are major barriers.

### Loss of control of their data

Cloud services are often tied to commercial contracts for sharing data with third parties. This means that once you place your data into the cloud ecosystem, you are prevented from extracting any enhanced data you generate there. Data JPS will provide software and services to allow government departments and agencies to ‘self host’ within a secure cloud environment and retain control of their data.

### Concerns over security and loss of social license

Most Government organisations have sensitive data, which often needs to be held at a Protected level. There are only a few cloud platforms that are certified by ASD at Protected level, which limits choice and acts as a significant barrier. Note: Dats JPS has an agreement with Microsoft to use their Government Protected Cloud facilities in Canberra – which is certified by ASD.

### No optionality

The services provided by many of our competitors do not allow flexibility in the settings or tools used with them. With this ‘black box’ approach end users have little flexibility to choose their preferred tools, or augment services with third party offers or their own.

For example, data linkage is a key service that public servants need. Data Linkage is a technique that connects different records that are thought to relate to the same person, business, place or event. In some cases false negatives are worse than false positives and vice versa – it is therefore important to allow users to control thresholds in matching. Data JPS offers a linkage service with fine grained control over matching rules and heuristics.

Additionally, taking one service or package from Data JPS has no dependency to use other offerings from Data JPS. Users have full optionality.

## Total Addressable Market

We understand that our competitors seek around AU $500k per year from each customer – which indicates an upper threshold for _total_ fees from each department. However, we are not using a Software as a Service model (SaaS) as such, but have the following revenue streams:

- Pay for early access (subscription based on volume by product)
- Pay for support (subscription based on volume by product)
- Pay for priority features (co-development of new features with IP retained by Data JPS)

Pricing has yet to be determined, but we anticipate customers will be prepared to pay an average AU $200k per year across all three areas – and this excludes cloud infrastructure costs.

For Australia, there are around 8-10 central departments per state or territory. So with 8 states/territories and assuming 8 departments each

TAM = 8 \* 8 \* $200k = $32M

## Customer research

We have consulted widely across the Victorian Public Sector (VPS) and with representatives from all Australian states and territories. We have identified 3 immediate clients from the VPS and there is strong interest from 4 others.
