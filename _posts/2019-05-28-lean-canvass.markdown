The Lean Canvas described above expresses the business of Data JPS on a single page. We have been very careful to choose metrics through an innovation framework and avoid vanity metrics that highlight artificial growth and not incremental business value. The choice of service adoption and consumption by cohort can provide ongoing conversion into average revenue per client â€“ but highlight how sticky the service is to our clients which is a strong indicator of the future health of the company.

Note that **_Data SuperConductor_** and all the related content for it **_is_**  **_not real - including this page. It's just a hypothetical university project._**
