TL;DR - please help my research by completing this [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5QNU26co7dAuk4XOvZNqUpq3hQkBRKXTYXjwOpOJDiC8cYQ/viewform) and let me know which of the 7 challenges in TDD for analytics and data are relevant to you. &nbsp;

Test -Driven Development (TDD) is a common pattern in software engineering that helps reduce cycle time, improve code quality and reduce production defects. Within data engineering and analytics projects, TDD is held up as best practice in development and maintenance lifecycle phases. Anecdotally, many organisations do not see the promised benefits of TDD in an analytics context, prompting the question:

> Why is it so hard to effectively implement Test Driven Development in an analytics platform?

The focus of my master's research is answering this question. I recently presented what I had so far at 2 MeetUp groups - '[Enterprise Data Science Architecture](https://www.meetup.com/Enterprise-Data-Science-Architecture/events/264027501/)' and '[AI Engineers of Melbourne](https://www.meetup.com/AIEng-Melbourne/events/265682295/)' on Monday. [Here are my slides](https://www.slideshare.net/PhilWatt/why-is-test-driven-development-so-hard-to-implement-in-an-analytics-platform).

There's more work to be done still, the work on the thesis is about halfway there. As the TL;DR bit asks, I'd love your help to complete a short 4-minute [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5QNU26co7dAuk4XOvZNqUpq3hQkBRKXTYXjwOpOJDiC8cYQ/viewform) on whether you recognise the 7 challenges that the academic literature describes, and how difficult they are to resolve.

Thanks for your support.
