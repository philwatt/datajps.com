This offer is designed for data scientists that require access to microdata to perform analytics and ask and answer questions in specific policy, service design and research areas that cannot be answered with the Policy Explorers. We provide a secure desktop environment hosted in our secure government protected cloud. Users will require 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) to access, and must have passed a training course that covers not only the technical operation and access, but ensures users acknowledge ethical responsibilities to the data.

From this desktop environment, users can access data in scalable databases – relational, graph, triple store and object store databases are available. With a ‘bring your own license’ capability, users can use their favourite desktop tools to analyse the data as long as they have their own license. Users don’t therefore pay twice for licenses they already hold, and don’t pay for software they don’t want to use.

## Minimum Viable Product

Bardeen is intended to provide a desktop environment with the following requirements

- PROTECTED level security
- Automated governance and security – reducing the time to access the data and start answering questions
- Highly scalable
- High quality data
- Flexible, bring your own tools and license capability

While security and governance remains critical, some scale and analytics features will follow. We will deliver Bardeen in three [phases](https://datajps.com/data-superconductor-roadmap/)

1. MVP1 – Security, governance, BYO License and small scale data (less than 500GB)
2. MVP2 – MVP1 plus large scale, relational database underneath
3. MVP3 – MVP2 plus large scale, graph database for non-relational data processing
