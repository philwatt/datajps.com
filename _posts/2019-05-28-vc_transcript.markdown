1. At Data JPS, we create frictionless analytics environments for public servants
  - we focus on the public sector, with highly secure, powerful and modular services
2. We connect data scientists, analysts and policy officers to data, tools and metadata so they can improve policy and service design
3. Getting access to the right data at the right time is really hard in the public sector.
  - public servants who own the data often fear that their data will be somehow abused, misinterpreted or used against them for political reasons.
4. A ‘One size fits all’ approach doesn’t work
  - Different tools are required for different needs
  - Data must be prepared or linked differently, depending on the use case or data quality
5. Current solutions assume that the data
  - is easy to get,
  - has no privacy restrictions
  - can be prepared, linked and integrated the same way, whatever the use case
6. Our Data Superconductor suite of products addresses these problems by creating an authorising environment where the data owner can monitor use of their data, and mitigate misuse of data
7. It provides meaningful context to the data, its quality, ownership and where to get help – in a self-contained but highly flexible environment.
8. Data scientists and analysts have full optionality on the tools they want to use, and fine-grained control of how to bring data together for analysis
9. Policy officers and executives get a series of intuitive policy explorer tools – that allow them to look at data around enduring policy questions.
10. Demand for integrated analytics in government is strong and growing, off the back of recommendations from the productivity commission and others.
11. We conservatively estimate the market size is $32M in Australian state government– but our solution applies equally to federal and local government. We have tested the market by speaking with analytics centres in each state government and received very positive feedback.
12. We know the demand for our solution is real, having received both business and technical validation. Now we seek help scaling the business, particularly around financial planning, product pricing and marketing.
