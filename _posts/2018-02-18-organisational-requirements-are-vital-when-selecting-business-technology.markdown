Perhaps the most critical component of technology selection relates to people and organisational culture. For example, emerging technologies can offer key technical or functional advantages – but still leave an organisation unable to answer the following question:

# How to create and maintain people structures to support scalable development of rare or bespoke technical skills.

In addition to assessing if the technology can address a particular business or functional requirement, the organisation must therefore consider the following areas of tool selection:

- Recruitment
- Retention
- On-boarding – getting people up to speed with the technical environment
- Developing and acquiring skills
- Ease of maintenance
- Change management – including dependency and impact analysis

When these dimensions are not addressed at an organisation and cultural level, there is a significant risk of failure in adopting the tool or technology.

The recent IEEE article from&nbsp; C. Soares, F. Batista and R. Ribeiro,&nbsp; “A simplified method to enhance the analysis for new information systems in corporate environments”, cited below, offers a framework for this issue that may be worth exploring.
