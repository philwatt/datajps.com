## Back to [Strategy](https://datajps.com/data-superconductor-strategy)

Our [MVP](https://datajps.com/data-superconductor-offers-and-mvp) pages break down the Data Superconductor product range and describes their Minimum Viable Product. Our development teams are already working on delivering these products, first to the Victorian Government as co-development partners, but then for supply to other government organisations.

The diagram below shows our product roadmap for the next 12 months. Some products are close to release, others are in development and others are in the planning stage. The diagram highlights in which development stage each product currently lies, and their delivery status. Clicking on the diagram will open a new tab/window with a zoomed in version of the roadmap.

Note that some of our deliverables depend on gathering data points from our clients, which has caused some schedule challenges indicated by some of the product statuses.

Note that **_Data SuperConductor_** and all the related content for it **_is_**  **_not real - including this page. It's just a hypothetical university project._**
